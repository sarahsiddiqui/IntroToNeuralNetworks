# IntroToNeuralNetworks

Research paper focusing on introducing neural networks from a mathematical background. This paper was a part of my International Baccalaureate Diploma requirements. 
This paper aims to bridge the gap between the basic concepts of neural networks and high school and undergraduate students. It will dissect the mathematics behind artificial intel- ligence using fundamental concepts. This paper provides a mathematical lens on neural networks from the standpoint of a student who has finished their undergraduate require- ments.
